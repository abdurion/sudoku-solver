# Sudoku Solver

simple solver for sudoku using backtracking recursively.

## Why is it a good challenge?
Recursion always sounded complicated and difficult. It can be difficult at first, once you understand the main tricks in it.
Then it is just a new fundemental concept under the belt. It can be very helpful tool to simplify complex problem by using
the same function until it solves it. I highly recommend you track the source code here and try to understand how is it running.
